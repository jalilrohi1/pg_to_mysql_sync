# Public Roadmap

## Short-Term (1-3 Months)
- **Enhance Sync Performance**: Optimize the synchronization process to handle larger datasets more efficiently using batch processing.
- **Add Transaction Rollback**: Implement better transaction handling to ensure consistency in case of sync failure between PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- **Improve Error Logging**: Enhance the logging mechanism to capture more detailed information about errors during synchronization.
- **API Documentation**: Complete API documentation using Swagger to help developers integrate easily.

## Mid-Term (3-6 Months)
- **Incremental Sync**: Implement functionality to support incremental synchronization, reducing overhead by only syncing changed or new data.
- **Conflict Resolution Logic**: Add a customizable conflict resolution mechanism to handle data discrepancies between PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- **Webhook Integration**: Add webhooks to notify external services about sync completions or errors.
- **Community Engagement**: Launch discussions and forums for contributors and users to suggest features and report bugs.

## Long-Term (6-12 Months)
- **API Version 2**: Introduce new features, including support for syncing more database types (e.g., SQL Server, MongoDB).
- **CLI Tool**: Develop a command-line tool for easier synchronization management and monitoring.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Explore adding real-time sync functionality using event-based systems.
- **Scalability**: Focus on making the API scalable for larger enterprise-level datasets with millions of records.
